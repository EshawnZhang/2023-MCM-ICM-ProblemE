## Methods at a Glance
- **Index design:** RLPRI integrates five drivers (e.g., public lighting electricity, population size, completed housing area, passenger and freight volumes).
- **Modeling:** standardized **multiple linear regression (OLS)** for RLPRI construction and inference; PCA suitability checks (**KMO** and **Bartlett’s test**).
- **Goodness-of-fit:** model \(R^2\) indicates strong explanatory power; significance tested via F-test.
- **Sensitivity & scenarios:** ± perturbations and scenario planning for key drivers; longitudinal comparisons across region types.
- **Visualization:** time-series and multi-factor charts to compare pre/post-intervention behavior.

## Key Findings (High-Level)
- **Regional gradient:** RLPRI increases from protected areas → rural/suburban → urban cores, aligning with intuition and urbanization intensity.
- **Policy priority:** early-phase **population control** can be impactful; as the city develops, **reducing public lighting electricity** tends to be the more stable long-run path.
- **Actionable guidance:** combining intelligent lighting (time-/zone-dimming and equipment upgrades) with fine-grained population and construction intensity management yields practical benefits under compliance constraints.
